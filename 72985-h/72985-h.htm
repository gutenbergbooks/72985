<h3>I</h3>
<div class="stanza">
<span>That is no country for old men. The young<br></span>
<span>In one another’s arms, birds in the trees,<br></span>
<span>—Those dying generations—at their song,<br></span>
<span>The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,<br></span>
<span>Fish flesh or fowl, commend all summer long<br></span>
<span>Whatever is begotten born and dies.<br></span>
<span>Caught in that sensual music all neglect<br></span>
<span>Monuments of unaging intellect.<br></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span>An aged man is but a paltry thing,<br></span>
<span>A tattered coat upon a stick, unless<br></span>
<span>Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing<br></span>
<span>For every tatter in its mortal dress,<br></span>
<span>Nor is there singing school but studying<br></span>
<span>Monuments of its own magnificence;<br></span>
<span>And therefore I have sailed the seas and come<br></span>
<span>To the holy city of Byzantium.<br></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span>O sages standing in God’s holy fire<br></span>
<span>As in the gold mosaic of a wall,<br></span>
<span>Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,<br></span>
<span>And be the singing masters of my soul.<br></span>
<span>Consume my heart away; sick with desire<br></span>
<span>And fastened to a dying animal<br></span>
<span>It knows not what it is; and gather me<br></span>
<span>Into the artifice of eternity.<br></span>

<span>Once out of nature I shall never take<br></span>
<span>My bodily form from any natural thing,<br></span>
<span>But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make<br></span>
<span>Of hammered gold and gold enamelling<br></span>
<span>To keep a drowsy emperor awake;<br></span>
<span>Or set upon a golden bough to sing<br></span>
<span>To lords and ladies of Byzantium<br></span>
<span>Of what is past, or passing, or to come.<br></span>

<h3>I</h3>
<div class="stanza">
<span>What shall I do with this absurdity—<br></span>
<span>O heart, O troubled heart—this caricature,<br></span>
<span>Decrepit age that has been tied to me<br></span>
<span class="dl2">
	<span>As to a dog’s tail?</span>
	<span>Never had I more</span>
<br></span>
<span>Excited, passionate, fantastical<br></span>
<span>Imagination, nor an ear and eye<br></span>
<span>That more expected the impossible—<br></span>
<span>No, not in boyhood when with rod and fly,<br></span>
<span>Or the humbler worm, I climbed Ben Bulben’s back<br></span>
<span>And had the livelong summer day to spend.<br></span>
<span>It seems that I must bid the Muse go pack,<br></span>
<span>Choose Plato and Plotinus for a friend<br></span>
<span>Until imagination, ear and eye,<br></span>
<span>Can be content with argument and deal<br></span>
<span>In abstract things; or be derided by<br></span>
<span>A sort of battered kettle at the heel.<br></span>
</div>
</div>

<div id="the-tower-2">

<h3>II</h3>
<div class="stanza">
<span>I pace upon the battlements and stare<br></span>
<span>On the foundations of a house, or where<br></span>
<span>Tree, like a sooty finger, starts from the earth;<br></span>
<span>And send imagination forth<br></span>
<span>Under the day’s declining beam, and call<br></span>
<span>Images and memories<br></span>
<span>From ruin or from ancient trees,<br></span>
<span>For I would ask a question of them all.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Beyond that ridge lived Mrs. French, and once<br></span>
<span>When every silver candlestick or sconce<br></span>
<span>Lit up the dark mahogany and the wine,<br></span>
<span>A serving man that could divine<br></span>
<span>That most respected lady’s every wish,<br></span>
<span>Ran and with the garden shears<br></span>
<span>Clipped an insolent farmer’s ears<br></span>
<span>And brought them in a little covered dish.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Some few remembered still when I was young<br></span>
<span>A peasant girl commended by a song,<br></span>
<span>Who’d lived somewhere upon that rocky place,<br></span>
<span>And praised the colour of her face,<br></span>
<span>And had the greater joy in praising her,<br></span>
<span>Remembering that, if walked she there,<br></span>
<span>Farmers jostled at the fair<br></span>
<span>So great a glory did the song confer.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>And certain men, being maddened by those rhymes,<br></span>
<span>Or else by toasting her a score of times,<br></span>
<span>Rose from the table and declared it right<br></span>
<span>To test their fancy by their sight;<br></span>
<span>But they mistook the brightness of the moon<br></span>
<span>For the prosaic light of day—<br></span>
<span>Music had driven their wits astray—<br></span>
<span>And one was drowned in the great bog of Cloone.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Strange, but the man who made the song was blind,<br></span>
<span>Yet, now I have considered it, I find<br></span>
<span>That nothing strange; the tragedy began<br></span>
<span>With Homer that was a blind man,<br></span>
<span>And Helen has all living hearts betrayed.<br></span>
<span>O may the moon and sunlight seem<br></span>
<span>One inextricable beam,<br></span>
<span>For if I triumph I must make men mad.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>And I myself created Hanrahan<br></span>
<span>And drove him drunk or sober through the dawn<br></span>
<span>From somewhere in the neighbouring cottages.<br></span>
<span>Caught by an old man’s juggleries<br></span>
<span>He stumbled, tumbled, fumbled to and fro<br></span>
<span>And had but broken knees for hire<br></span>
<span>And horrible splendour of desire;<br></span>
<span>I thought it all out twenty years ago:<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Good fellows shuffled cards in an old bawn;<br></span>
<span>And when that ancient ruffian’s turn was on<br></span>
<span>He so bewitched the cards under his thumb<br></span>
<span>That all, but the one card, became<br></span>
<span>A pack of hounds and not a pack of cards,<br></span>
<span>And that he changed into a hare.<br></span>
<span>Hanrahan rose in frenzy there<br></span>
<span>And followed up those baying creatures towards—<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>O towards I have forgotten what—enough!<br></span>
<span>I must recall a man that neither love<br></span>
<span>Nor music nor an enemy’s clipped ear<br></span>
<span>Could, he was so harried, cheer;<br></span>
<span>A figure that has grown so fabulous<br></span>
<span>There’s not a neighbour left to say<br></span>
<span>When he finished his dog’s day:<br></span>
<span>An ancient bankrupt master of this house.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Before that ruin came, for centuries,<br></span>
<span>Rough men-at-arms, cross-gartered to the knees<br></span>
<span>Or shod in iron, climbed the narrow stairs,<br></span>
<span>And certain men-at-arms there were<br></span>
<span>Whose images, in the Great Memory stored,<br></span>
<span>Come with loud cry and panting breast<br></span>
<span>To break upon a sleeper’s rest<br></span>
<span>While their great wooden dice beat on the board.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>As I would question all, come all who can;<br></span>
<span>Come old, necessitous, half-mounted man;<br></span>
<span>And bring beauty’s blind rambling celebrant;<br></span>
<span>The red man the juggler sent<br></span>
<span>Through God-forsaken meadows; Mrs. French,<br></span>
<span>Gifted with so fine an ear;<br></span>
<span>The man drowned in a bog’s mire,<br></span>
<span>When mocking muses chose the country wench.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Did all old men and women, rich and poor,<br></span>
<span>Who trod upon these rocks or passed this door,<br></span>
<span>Whether in public or in secret rage<br></span>
<span>As I do now against old age?<br></span>
<span>But I have found an answer in those eyes<br></span>
<span>That are impatient to be gone;<br></span>
<span>Go therefore; but leave Hanrahan<br></span>
<span>For I need all his mighty memories.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Old lecher with a love on every wind<br></span>
<span>Bring up out of that deep considering mind<br></span>
<span>All that you have discovered in the grave,<br></span>
<span>For it is certain that you have<br></span>
<span>Reckoned up every unforeknown, unseeing<br></span>
<span>Plunge, lured by a softening eye,<br></span>
<span>Or by a touch or a sigh,<br></span>
<span>Into the labyrinth of another’s being;<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Does the imagination dwell the most<br></span>
<span>Upon a woman won or woman lost?<br></span>
<span>If on the lost, admit you turned aside<br></span>
<span>From a great labyrinth out of pride,<br></span>
<span>Cowardice, some silly over-subtle thought<br></span>
<span>Or anything called conscience once;<br></span>
<span>And that if memory recur, the sun’s<br></span>
<span>Under eclipse and the day blotted out.<br></span>
</div>
</div>

<div id="the-tower-3">

<h3>III</h3>
<div class="stanza">
<span>It is time that I wrote my will;<br></span>
<span>I choose upstanding men,<br></span>
<span>That climb the streams until<br></span>
<span>The fountain leap, and at dawn<br></span>
<span>Drop their cast at the side<br></span>
<span>Of dripping stone; I declare<br></span>
<span>They shall inherit my pride,<br></span>
<span>The pride of people that were<br></span>
<span>Bound neither to Cause nor to State,<br></span>
<span>Neither to slaves that were spat on,<br></span>
<span>Nor to the tyrants that spat,<br></span>
<span>The people of Burke and of Grattan<br></span>
<span>That gave, though free to refuse—<br></span>
<span>Pride, like that of the morn,<br></span>
<span>When the headlong light is loose,<br></span>
<span>Or that of the fabulous horn,<br></span>
<span>Or that of the sudden shower<br></span>
<span>When all streams are dry,<br></span>
<span>Or that of the hour<br></span>
<span>When the swan must fix his eye<br></span>
<span>Upon a fading gleam,<br></span>
<span>Float out upon a long<br></span>
<span>Last reach of glittering stream<br></span>
<span>And there sing his last song.<br></span>
<span>And I declare my faith;<br></span>
<span>I mock Plotinus’ thought<br></span>
<span>And cry in Plato’s teeth,<br></span>
<span>Death and life were not<br></span>
<span>Till man made up the whole,<br></span>
<span>Made lock, stock and barrel<br></span>
<span>Out of his bitter soul,<br></span>
<span>Aye, sun and moon and star, all,<br></span>
<span>And further add to that<br></span>
<span>That, being dead, we rise,<br></span>
<span>Dream and so create<br></span>
<span>Translunar Paradise.<br></span>
<span>I have prepared my peace<br></span>
<span>With learned Italian things<br></span>
<span>And the proud stones of Greece,<br></span>
<span>Poet’s imaginings<br></span>
<span>And memories of love,<br></span>
<span>Memories of the words of women,<br></span>
<span>All those things whereof<br></span>
<span>Man makes a superhuman,<br></span>
<span>Mirror-resembling dream.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>As at the loophole there,<br></span>
<span>The daws chatter and scream,<br></span>
<span>And drop twigs layer upon layer.<br></span>
<span>When they have mounted up,<br></span>
<span>The mother bird will rest<br></span>
<span>On their hollow top,<br></span>
<span>And so warm her wild nest.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>I leave both faith and pride<br></span>
<span>To young upstanding men<br></span>
<span>Climbing the mountain side,<br></span>
<span>That under bursting dawn<br></span>
<span>They may drop a fly;<br></span>
<span>Being of that metal made<br></span>
<span>Till it was broken by<br></span>
<span>This sedentary trade.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Now shall I make my soul<br></span>
<span>Compelling it to study<br></span>
<span>In a learned school<br></span>
<span>Till the wreck of body<br></span>
<span>Slow decay of blood,<br></span>
<span>Testy delirium<br></span>
<span>Or dull decrepitude,<br></span>
<span>Or what worse evil come—<br></span>
<span>The death of friends, or death<br></span>
<span>Of every brilliant eye<br></span>
<span>That made a catch in the breath—<br></span>
<span>Seem but the clouds of the sky<br></span>
<span>When the horizon fades;<br></span>
<span>Or a bird’s sleepy cry<br></span>
<span>Among the deepening shades.<br></span>

Ancestral Houses</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span>Surely among a rich man’s flowering lawns,<br></span>
<span>Amid the rustle of his planted hills,<br></span>
<span>Life overflows without ambitious pains;<br></span>
<span>And rains down life until the basin spills,<br></span>
<span>And mounts more dizzy high the more it rains<br></span>
<span>As though to choose whatever shape it wills<br></span>
<span>And never stoop to a mechanical,<br></span>
<span>Or servile shape, at others’ beck and call.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Mere dreams, mere dreams! Yet Homer had not sung<br></span>
<span>Had he not found it certain beyond dreams<br></span>
<span>That out of life’s own self-delight had sprung<br></span>
<span>The abounding glittering jet; though now it seems<br></span>
<span>As if some marvellous empty sea-shell flung<br></span>
<span>Out of the obscure dark of the rich streams,<br></span>
<span>And not a fountain, were the symbol which<br></span>
<span>Shadows the inherited glory of the rich.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Some violent bitter man, some powerful man<br></span>
<span>Called architect and artist in, that they,<br></span>
<span>Bitter and violent men, might rear in stone<br></span>
<span>The sweetness that all longed for night and day,<br></span>
<span>The gentleness none there had ever known;<br></span>
<span>But when the master’s buried mice can play,<br></span>
<span>And maybe the great-grandson of that house,<br></span>
<span>For all its bronze and marble, ’s but a mouse.<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Oh, what if gardens where the peacock strays<br></span>
<span>With delicate feet upon old terraces,<br></span>
<span>Or else all Juno from an urn displays<br></span>
<span>Before the indifferent garden deities;<br></span>
<span>Oh, what if levelled lawns and gravelled ways<br></span>
<span>Where slippered Contemplation finds his ease<br></span>
<span>And Childhood a delight for every sense,<br></span>
<span>But take our greatness with our violence!<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>What if the glory of escutcheoned doors,<br></span>
<span>And buildings that a haughtier age designed,<br></span>
<span>The pacing to and fro on polished floors<br></span>
<span>Amid great chambers and long galleries, lined<br></span>
<span>With famous portraits of our ancestors;<br></span>
<span>What if those things the greatest of mankind,<br></span>
<span>Consider most to magnify, or to bless,<br></span>
<span>But take our greatness with our bitterness!<br></span>

My House</h3>

<span>An ancient bridge, and a more ancient tower,<br></span>
<span>A farmhouse that is sheltered by its wall,<br></span>
<span>An acre of stony ground,<br></span>
<span>Where the symbolic rose can break in flower,<br></span>
<span>Old ragged elms, old thorns innumerable,<br></span>
<span>The sound of the rain or sound<br></span>
<span>Of every wind that blows;<br></span>
<span>The stilted water-hen<br></span>
<span>Crossing stream again<br></span>
<span>Scared by the splashing of a dozen cows;<br></span>

<span>A candle and written page.<br></span>

<span>How the daemonic rage<br></span>
<span>Imagined everything.<br></span>
<span>Benighted travellers<br></span>
<span>From markets and from fairs<br></span>

<span>Your hooves have stamped at the black margin of the wood,<br></span>

<span>What wholesome sun has ripened is wholesome food to eat<br></span>
<span>And that alone; yet I, being driven half insane<br></span>
<span>Because of some green wing, gathered old mummy wheat<br></span>
<span>In the mad abstract dark and ground it grain by grain<br></span>
<span>And after baked it slowly in an oven; but now<br></span>
<span>I bring full flavoured wine out of a barrel found<br></span>
<span>Where seven Ephesian topers slept and never knew<br></span>
<span>When Alexander’s empire past, they slept so sound.<br></span>
<span>Stretch out your limbs and sleep a long Saturnian sleep;<br></span>
<span>I have loved you better than my soul for all my words,<br></span>

<span>At the great book of Sappho’s song; but no,<br></span>
<span>For should you leave my letter there, a boy’s<br></span>
<span>Love-lorn, indifferent hands might come upon it<br></span>
<span>And let it fall unnoticed to the floor.<br></span>
<span>Pause at the Treatise of Parmenides<br></span>
<span>And hide it there, for Caliphs to world’s end<br></span>
<span>Must keep that perfect, as they keep her song<br></span>
<span class="dl2">
	<span>So great its fame.</span>
	<span>When fitting time has passed</span>
<br></span>
<span>The parchment will disclose to some learned man<br></span>
<span>A mystery that else had found no chronicler<br></span>
<span>But the wild Bedouin. Though I approve<br></span>
<span>Those wanderers that welcomed in their tents<br></span>
<span>What great Harun Al-Rashid, occupied<br></span>
<span>With Persian embassy or Grecian war,<br></span>
<span>Must needs neglect; I cannot hide the truth<br></span>
<span>That wandering in a desert, featureless<br></span>
<span>As air under a wing, can give birds’ wit.<br></span>
<span>In after time they will speak much of me<br></span>
<span>And speak but phantasy. Recall the year<br></span>
<span>When our beloved Caliph put to death<br></span>
<span>His Vizir Jaffer for an unknown reason;<br></span>
<span>‘If but the shirt upon my body knew it<br></span>
<span>I’d tear it off and throw it in the fire.’<br></span>
<span>That speech was all that the town knew, but he<br></span>
<span>Seemed for a while to have grown young again;<br></span>
<span>Seemed so on purpose, muttered Jaffer’s friends,<br></span>
<span>That none might know that he was conscience struck—<br></span>
<span>But that’s a traitor’s thought. Enough for me<br></span>
<span>That in the early summer of the year<br></span>
<span>The mightiest of the princes of the world<br></span>
<span>Came to the least considered of his courtiers;<br></span>
<span>Sat down upon the fountain’s marble edge<br></span>
<span>One hand amid the goldfish in the pool;<br></span>
<span>And thereupon a colloquy took place<br></span>
<span>That I commend to all the chroniclers<br></span>
<span>To show how violent great hearts can lose<br></span>
<span>Their bitterness and find the honey-comb.<br></span>
<span>‘I have brought a slender bride into the house;<br></span>
<span>You know the saying “Change the bride with Spring”,<br></span>
<span>And she and I, being sunk in happiness,<br></span>
<span>Cannot endure to think you tread these paths,<br></span>
<span>When evening stirs the jasmine, and yet<br></span>
<span class="dl2">
	<span>Are brideless.’</span>
	<span>‘I am falling into years.’</span>
<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>‘But such as you and I do not seem old<br></span>
<span>Like men who live by habit. Every day<br></span>
<span>I ride with falcon to the river’s edge<br></span>
<span>Or carry the ringed mail upon my back,<br></span>
<span>Or court a woman; neither enemy,<br></span>
<span>Game-bird, nor woman does the same thing twice;<br></span>
<span>And so a hunter carries in the eye<br></span>
<span>A mimicry of youth. Can poet’s thought<br></span>
<span>That springs from body and in body falls<br></span>
<span>Like this pure jet, now lost amid blue sky<br></span>
<span>Now bathing lily leaf and fishes’ scale,<br></span>
<span class="dl2">
	<span>Be mimicry?’</span>
	<span>‘What matter if our souls</span>
<br></span>
<span>Are nearer to the surface of the body<br></span>
<span>Than souls that start no game and turn no rhyme!<br></span>
<span>The soul’s own youth and not the body’s youth<br></span>
<span>Shows through our lineaments. My candle’s bright,<br></span>
<span>My lantern is too loyal not to show<br></span>
<span>That it was made in your great father’s reign.’<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>‘And yet the jasmine season warms our blood.’<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>‘Great prince, forgive the freedom of my speech;<br></span>
<span>You think that love has seasons, and you think<br></span>
<span>That if the spring bear off what the spring gave<br></span>
<span>The heart need suffer no defeat; but I<br></span>
<span>Who have accepted the Byzantine faith,<br></span>
<span>That seems unnatural to Arabian minds,<br></span>
<span>Think when I choose a bride I choose for ever;<br></span>
<span>And if her eye should not grow bright for mine<br></span>
<span>Or brighten only for some younger eye,<br></span>
<span>My heart could never turn from daily ruin,<br></span>
<span class="dl2">
	<span>Nor find a remedy.’</span>
	<span>‘But what if I</span>
<br></span>
<span>Have lit upon a woman, who so shares<br></span>
<span>Your thirst for those old crabbed mysteries,<br></span>
<span>So strains to look beyond our life, an eye<br></span>
<span>That never knew that strain would scarce seem bright,<br></span>
<span>And yet herself can seem youth’s very fountain,<br></span>
<span class="dl2">
	<span>Being all brimmed with life.’</span>
	<span>‘Were it but true</span>
<br></span>
<span>I would have found the best that life can give,<br></span>
<span>Companionship in those mysterious things<br></span>
<span>That make a man’s soul or a woman’s soul<br></span>
<span class="dl2">
	<span>Itself and not some other soul.’</span>
	<span>‘That love</span>
<br></span>
<span>Must needs be in this life and in what follows<br></span>
<span>Unchanging and at peace, and it is right<br></span>
<span>Every philosopher should praise that love.<br></span>
<span>But I being none can praise its opposite.<br></span>
<span>It makes my passion stronger but to think<br></span>
<span>Like passion stirs the peacock and his mate,<br></span>
<span>The wild stag and the doe; that mouth to mouth<br></span>
<span>Is a man’s mockery of the changeless soul.’<br></span>
<span>And thereupon his bounty gave what now<br></span>
<span>Can shake more blossom from autumnal chill<br></span>
<span>Than all my bursting springtime knew. A girl<br></span>
<span>Perched in some window of her mother’s house<br></span>
<span>Had watched my daily passage to and fro;<br></span>
<span>Had heard impossible history of my past;<br></span>
<span>Imagined some impossible history<br></span>
<span>Lived at my side; thought time’s disfiguring touch<br></span>
<span>Gave but more reason for a woman’s care.<br></span>
<span>Yet was it love of me, or was it love<br></span>
<span>Of the stark mystery that has dazed my sight,<br></span>
<span>Perplexed her phantasy and planned her care?<br></span>
<span>Or did the torchlight of that mystery<br></span>
<span>Pick out my features in such light and shade<br></span>
<span>Two contemplating passions chose one theme<br></span>
<span>Through sheer bewilderment? She had not paced<br></span>
<span>The garden paths, nor counted up the rooms,<br></span>
<span>Before she had spread a book upon her knees<br></span>
<span>And asked about the pictures or the text;<br></span>
<span>And often those first days I saw her stare<br></span>
<span>On old dry writing in a learned tongue,<br></span>
<span>On old dry faggots that could never please<br></span>
<span>The extravagance of spring; or move a hand<br></span>
<span>As if that writing or the figured page<br></span>
<span class="dl2">
	<span>Were some dear cheek.</span>
	<span>Upon a moonless night </span>
<br></span>
<span>I sat where I could watch her sleeping form,<br></span>
<span>And wrote by candle-light; but her form moved,<br></span>
<span>And fearing that my light disturbed her sleep<br></span>
<span>I rose that I might screen it with a cloth.<br></span>
<span>I heard her voice, ‘Turn that I may expound<br></span>
<span>What’s bowed your shoulder and made pale your cheek’;<br></span>
<span>And saw her sitting upright on the bed;<br></span>
<span>Or was it she that spoke or some great Djinn?<br></span>
<span>I say that a Djinn spoke. A live-long hour<br></span>
<span>She seemed the learned man and I the child;<br></span>
<span>Truths without father came, truths that no book<br></span>
<span>Of all the uncounted books that I have read,<br></span>
<span>Nor thought out of her mind or mine begot,<br></span>
<span>Self-born, high-born, and solitary truths,<br></span>
<span>Those terrible implacable straight lines<br></span>
<span>Drawn through the wandering vegetative dream,<br></span>
<span>Even those truths that when my bones are dust<br></span>
<span class="dl2">
	<span>Must drive the Arabian host.</span>
	<span>The voice grew still,</span>
<br></span>
<span>And she lay down upon her bed and slept,<br></span>
<span>But woke at the first gleam of day, rose up<br></span>
<span>And swept the house and sang about her work<br></span>
<span>In childish ignorance of all that passed.<br></span>
<span>A dozen nights of natural sleep, and then<br></span>
<span>When the full moon swam to its greatest height<br></span>
<span>She rose, and with her eyes shut fast in sleep<br></span>
<span>Walked through the house. Unnoticed and unfelt<br></span>
<span>I wrapped her in a heavy hooded cloak, and she,<br></span>
<span>Half running, dropped at the first ridge of the desert<br></span>
<span>And there marked out those emblems on the sand<br></span>
<span>That day by day I study and marvel at,<br></span>
<span>With her white finger. I led her home asleep<br></span>
<span>And once again she rose and swept the house<br></span>
<span>In childish ignorance of all that passed.<br></span>
<span>Even to-day, after some seven years<br></span>
<span>When maybe thrice in every moon her mouth<br></span>
<span>Murmured the wisdom of the desert Djinns,<br></span>
<span>She keeps that ignorance, nor has she now<br></span>
<span>That first unnatural interest in my books.<br></span>
<span>It seems enough that I am there; and yet<br></span>
<span>Old fellow student, whose most patient ear<br></span>
<span>Heard all the anxiety of my passionate youth,<br></span>
<span>It seems I must buy knowledge with my peace.<br></span>
<span>What if she lose her ignorance and so<br></span>
<span>Dream that I love her only for the voice,<br></span>
<span>That every gift and every word of praise<br></span>
<span>Is but a payment for that midnight voice<br></span>
<span>That is to age what milk is to a child!<br></span>
<span>Were she to lose her love, because she had lost<br></span>
<span>Her confidence in mine, or even lose<br></span>
<span>Its first simplicity, love, voice and all,<br></span>
<span>All my fine feathers would be plucked away<br></span>
<span>And I left shivering. The voice has drawn<br></span>
<span>A quality of wisdom from her love’s<br></span>
<span>Particular quality. The signs and shapes;<br></span>
<span>All those abstractions that you fancied were<br></span>
<span>From the great treatise of Parmenides;<br></span>
<span>All, all those gyres and cubes and midnight things<br></span>
<span>Are but a new expression of her body<br></span>
<span>Drunk with the bitter sweetness of her youth.<br></span>
<span>And now my utmost mystery is out.<br></span>
<span>A woman’s beauty is a storm-tossed banner;<br></span>
<span>Under it wisdom stands, and I alone—<br></span>
<span>Of all Arabia’s lovers I alone—<br></span>
<span>Nor dazzled by the embroidery, nor lost<br></span>
<span>In the confusion of its night-dark folds,<br></span>
<span>Can hear the armed man speak.<br></span>

<span>Midnight has come and the great Christ Church Bell,<br></span>

<span>A certain marvellous thing<br></span>
<span>None but the living mock,<br></span>

<span>H⸺’s the first I call. He loved strange thought<br></span>

<span>Nothing could bring him, when his lady died,<br></span>
<span>Anodyne for his love.<br></span>
<span>Words were but wasted breath;<br></span>
<span>One dear hope had he:<br></span>
<span>The inclemency<br></span>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Two thoughts were so mixed up I could not tell<br></span>

<span>And that a slight companionable ghost,<br></span>
<span>Wild with divinity,<br></span>
<span>Had so lit up the whole<br></span>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<h3>SAILING TO BYZANTIUM</h3>
<h4>Stanza IV</h4>

<p>I have read somewhere that in the Emperor’s palace at Byzantium was a tree made of gold
and silver, and artificial birds that sang.</p>

<h3>THE TOWER. Part II</h3>

<p>The persons mentioned are associated by legend, story and tradition with the neighbourhood of Thoor Ballylee or Ballylee Castle, where the poem was written. Mrs. French lived at Peterswell in the eighteenth century and was related to Sir Jonah Barrington, who described the incident of the ear and the trouble that came of it. The peasant beauty and the blind poet are Mary Hynes and Raftery, and the incident of the man drowned in Cloone Bog is recorded in my <i>Celtic Twilight</i>. Hanrahan’s pursuit of the phantom hare and hounds is from my <i>Stories of Red Hanrahan</i>. The ghosts have been seen at their game of dice in what is now my bedroom, and the old bankrupt man lived about a hundred years ago. According to one legend he could only leave the Castle upon a Sunday because of his creditors, and according to another he hid in the secret passage.</p>

<h3>THE TOWER. Part III</h3>

<p>In the passage about the Swan I have unconsciously echoed one of the loveliest lyrics of our time—Mr. Sturge Moore’s ‘Dying Swan’. I often recited it during an American lecturing tour, which explains the theft.</p>

<blockquote id="the-dying-swan">
<h4 style="page-break-after:avoid;">The Dying Swan</h4>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span>O silver-throated Swan<br></span>
<span>Struck, struck! A golden dart<br></span>
<span>Clean through thy breast has gone<br></span>
<span>Home to thy heart.<br></span>
<span>Thrill, thrill, O silver throat!<br></span>
<span>O silver trumpet, pour<br></span>
<span>Love for defiance back<br></span>
<span>On him who smote!<br></span>
<span>And brim, brim o’er<br></span>
<span>With love; and ruby-dye thy track<br></span>
<span>Down thy last living reach<br></span>
<span>Of river, sail the golden light—<br></span>
<span>Enter the sun’s heart—even teach,<br></span>
<span>O wondrous-gifted pain, teach thou<br></span>
<span>The God to love, let him learn how!<br></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>When I wrote the lines about Plato and Plotinus I forgot that it is something in our own eyes that makes us see them as all transcendence. Has not Plotinus written: ‘Let every soul recall, then, at the outset the truth that soul is the author of all living things, that it has breathed the life into them all, whatever is nourished by earth and sea, all the creatures of the air, the divine stars in the sky; it is the maker of the sun; itself formed and ordered this vast heaven and conducts all that rhythmic motion—and it is a principle distinct from all these to which it gives law and movement and life, and it must of necessity be more honourable than they, for they gather or dissolve as soul brings them life or abandons them, but soul, since it never can abandon
itself, is of eternal being’.</p>

<h3>MEDITATIONS IN TIME OF CIVIL WAR</h3>

<p>These poems were written at Thoor Ballylee in 1922, during the civil war. Before they were finished the Republicans blew up our ‘ancient bridge’ one midnight. They forbade us to leave the house, but were otherwise polite, even saying at last ‘Goodnight, thank you’ as though we had given them the bridge.</p>

<h4>Section Six</h4>

<p>In the West of Ireland we call a starling a stare, and during the civil war one built in a hole in the masonry by my bedroom window.</p>

<h4>Section Seven, Stanza II</h4>

<p>The cry ‘Vengeance on the murderers of Jacques Molay’, Grand Master of the Templars, seems to me fit symbol for those who labour from hatred, and so for sterility in various kinds. It is said to have been incorporated in the ritual of certain Masonic societies of the eighteenth century, and to have fed class-hatred.</p>

<h4>Section Seven, Stanza IV</h4>

<p>I have a ring with a hawk and a butterfly upon it, to symbolise the straight road of logic, and so of mechanism, and the crooked road of intuition: ‘For wisdom is a butterfly and not a gloomy bird of prey’.</p>

<h3>NINETEEN HUNDRED AND NINETEEN</h3>

<h4>Section Six</h4>

<p>The country people see at times certain apparitions whom they name now ‘fallen angels’, now ‘ancient inhabitants of the country’, and describe as riding at whiles ‘with flowers upon the heads of the horses’. I have assumed in the sixth poem that these horsemen, now that the times worsen, give way to worse. My last symbol, Robert Artisson, was an evil spirit much run after in Kilkenny at the start of the fourteenth century. Are not those who travel in the whirling dust also in the Platonic Year?</p>

<h3>TWO SONGS FROM A PLAY</h3>

<p>These songs are sung by the Chorus in a play that has for its theme Christ’s first appearance to the Apostles after the Resurrection, a play intended for performance in a drawing-room
or studio.</p>

<h3>AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN</h3>

<h4>Stanza III</h4>

<p>I have taken ‘the honey of generation’ from Porphyry’s essay on ‘The Cave of the Nymphs’, but find no warrant in Porphyry for considering it the ‘drug’ that destroys the ‘recollection’ of pre-natal freedom. He blamed a cup of oblivion given in the zodiacal sign of Cancer.</p>

<h3>THE GIFT OF HARUN AL-RASHID</h3>

<p>Part of an unfinished set of poems, dialogues and stories about John Ahern and Michael Robartes, Kusta ben Luka, a philosopher of Bagdad, and his Bedouin followers.</p>
